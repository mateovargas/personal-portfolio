            info: 'Mateo Vargas has recently completed an MSc at the University of Edinburgh where I supervised his MSc dissertation entitled "Discrete SIR Game for Understanding Epidemics". This involved creating a game using the Unity platform to simulate the spread of an infectious disease through a population. Mateo took ownership of this problem and made it his own, teaching himself the skills necessary to create an effective simulation on the Unity platform.I was impressed by his level of engagement with the project, and his project management and technical skills and have no hesitation in recommending him to you as a very good hire.'
